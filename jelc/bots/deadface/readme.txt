this is the code for my bot "deadface"

usage:
you need to create a default guild list (list.txt) and jokerList.txt, then run it with:
MyBot username password [hostname port]



todo:
- tell me some idea's, is there a simple game that i could add?

done:
- add enhanced actors to jelc (mostly done i think)
- modify actors(or ehnanced actors) to have getGuild()
- add players seen list to store people the bot sees
- then set online to display your guild


* if you have a command idea tell me (dns) in game or through the el froums.



changelog:

.7 (dns) made quite a lot of changes, the bot now 'sees' people it has the 'on' command and 'on guild' command
         also stats and skills will show the guild (if i've seen them)

.6 (dns) added outputList to help format the printing of lists, it will put the most possible people on a line

.5 (dns) submitted it to cvs :)
