this is the code for my bot "deadface"

usage:
you need to create a default guild list (list.txt) and jokerList.txt, then run it with:
MyBot username password [hostname port]



todo:
- add enhanced actors to jelc (mostly done i think)
- modify actors(or ehnanced actors) to have getGuild()
- add players seen list to store people the bot sees
- then set online to display your guild

* if you have a command that it doesn't do pm dns in game



changelog:


.6 (dns) added outputList to help format the printing of lists, it will put the most possible people on a line

.5 (dns) submitted it to cvs :)
