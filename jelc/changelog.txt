- changed onAddNewActor(packet p), replaceing it with:  onActor(Actor a) because it will be more usefull
- changed onRemoveActor(), replaceing it with onRemoveActor(Actor a) to be more usefull
- Actors are now stored in a Hashtable this is to save space(don't need a huge vector) while maintainnig performance

Actor.java:
+ some bug fixes, ie ID is correct
+ added Getter's and Setters for all parameters (eclipse is cool)
+ added a toString() (for debug) will replace with returning the name later once the class works better


simpleBot.java:
+created a simple bot. When it sees 'hi' in local chat, it replies with 'hi USERNAME'
