my changes:
* Client no longer extends Thread, instead it implements runnable, this is to make dealing with threads a little easyer.
- start() now calls connect()
- connect() sets up the connection and spawns the threads that deal with the client
-reconnect() is called when a connection is lost and should reconnect correctly
also did quite a bit of code cleanup. ie when a client laggs out it should  (hopefully) automatically reconnect

+ created EnhancedActor and modified Actor a little
+ created ActorInterface for recieveing addActor addEnhancedActor and RemoveActor events


(dns) 15/4/2005
+altered the signature for onPmSent to: void onPmSent(String person, String message);
+added public void onChangeMap(String map) for when you change maps
+added a new interface SystemInterface, this will have system events.

+ added ClientConnection provides a wrapper around client, to allow the use of clientInterface
+ added Clientnterface this is an interface that can be used to recieve events
+ added SimpleGui this provides a simple gui chat client, it is an example of how to use ClientInterface

(dns) - 9/2/2005
client.java:

  they work 
   * onChat(name,message),
   * onPm(name,message),
   * onGm(name,message),
   * onChannelChat(name,message)
+added lots of send Message methods to make it easyer for directed communications, makeing bot creation easyer.
   * public  void chatPm(String text)
   * public void chatPm(String name, String message
   * public void chatGm(String message)
   * public void chatChannel(String message)     
- changed onAddNewActor(packet p), replaceing it with:  onActor(Actor a) because it will be more usefull
- changed onRemoveActor(), replaceing it with onRemoveActor(Actor a) to be more usefull
- Actors are now stored in a Hashtable this is to save space(don't need a huge vector) while maintainnig performance

Actor.java:
+ some bug fixes, ie ID is correct
+ added Getter's and Setters for all parameters (eclipse is cool)
+ added a toString() (for debug) will replace with returning the name later once the class works better


simpleBot.java:
+created a simple bot. When it sees 'hi' in local chat, it replies with 'hi USERNAME'
