This is me writeing a simple (hopefully) gui eternal lands client.

seting up:
1. copy map bmp files from eternal lands to a /maps/
2. create (or copy) a /lists/ folder which contains player lists (like playerView)

running:
java -jar gui.jar username password
or
java -jar gui.jar username password hostname port



what it currently does:
+contains the ability to chat
+shows who is online, allows the ability to read player stats, and start a pm conversation with the person
+shows a simple map reperesentation 
+shows creatures people and animals you can see. (buggy)


what it doesn't do:
-most stuff eg:
-no moveing, or even showing your location (comeing soon)
-no interacting with the world eg harvesting fighting etc.
